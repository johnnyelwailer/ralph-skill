# Review Log

## Review — 2026-03-14 12:20 — commit b9b359b..deb2a20

**Verdict: FAIL** (5 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/gh.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/gh.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`

- Gate 1: Triage helpers are implemented but not integrated into a real orchestrator monitor-cycle polling path.
- Gate 1: Spec-required comment behaviors are incomplete (`needs_clarification` follow-up question, `question` answer comment, agent-footer marking, authorship filtering).
- Gate 2: New triage action tests assert partial command shape (`includes`) and miss key branches/error paths.
- Gate 3: `gh.ts` branch coverage is 78.46% (<80% threshold).
- Gate 6: Proof manifest artifact paths are not present in workspace, so evidence is not verifiable.

## Review — 2026-03-14 13:48 — commit 1ea560a..a31cc39

**Verdict: FAIL** (3 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `SPEC.md`, `TODO.md`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`

- Gate 1: Triage polling was added, but the callsite is only initialization-time (`orchestrateCommandWithDeps`), not a continuous monitor-loop step; additionally, `action_taken: "steering_injected"` does not actually inject steering into child loop inputs.
- Gate 5: Validation gate remains red: `cd aloop/cli && npm test` fails with `src/commands/session.test.ts` (`resolveHomeDir trims trailing separators and falls back to os.homedir`), so full-suite regression safety is not met.
- Gate 6: Proof manifest lists `proof-run.log`, `monitor-cycle-proof.json`, and `triage-action-policy-proof.json`, but none exist in the workspace, so evidence is not verifiable.
- Gate 2 observation: triage tests are materially improved (exact GH arg assertions for clarification/question paths, mixed-classification batch case, and execGh error propagation checks).
- Gate 3 observation: measured with `c8` on `orchestrate.test.ts` run, `orchestrate.ts` branch coverage is 88.49% (>80% threshold).

## Review — 2026-03-14 13:18 — commit 6983165..48281d8

**Verdict: FAIL** (2 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/lib/session.mjs`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`, proof artifacts

- Gate 1: `applyTriageResultsToIssue` marks actionable comments as `steering_injected` even when `issue.child_session` is absent; `injectSteeringToChildLoop` then no-ops, but the comment is still marked processed, so actionable guidance can be lost pre-dispatch.
- Gate 2: New steering tests only cover the path where `child_session` exists; there is no regression test for the no-child-session branch where steering injection is currently skipped.
- Gate 3 observation: Coverage evidence from `c8` shows touched production files above threshold (`lib/session.mjs` branches 93.33%, `src/commands/orchestrate.ts` branches 88.66%).
- Gate 5 observation: `cd aloop/cli && npm test && npm run type-check && npm run build` all pass.
- Gate 6 observation: previously missing proof artifacts now exist (`proof-run.log`, `monitor-cycle-proof.json`, `triage-action-policy-proof.json`) and are internally consistent with the triage/session work claimed in this range.
