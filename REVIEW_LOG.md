# Review Log

## Review — 2026-03-14 12:20 — commit b9b359b..deb2a20

**Verdict: FAIL** (5 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/gh.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/gh.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`

- Gate 1: Triage helpers are implemented but not integrated into a real orchestrator monitor-cycle polling path.
- Gate 1: Spec-required comment behaviors are incomplete (`needs_clarification` follow-up question, `question` answer comment, agent-footer marking, authorship filtering).
- Gate 2: New triage action tests assert partial command shape (`includes`) and miss key branches/error paths.
- Gate 3: `gh.ts` branch coverage is 78.46% (<80% threshold).
- Gate 6: Proof manifest artifact paths are not present in workspace, so evidence is not verifiable.
