# Review Log

## Review — 2026-03-27 — commits 9773abc30..b64a47316 (first review; no prior log)

**Verdict: FAIL** (3 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/lib/adapter.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/lib/adapter.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`

### Gate 1 FAIL — Interface shape deviates from spec (SPEC-ADDENDUM.md §"Orchestrator Adapter Pattern")

The `OrchestratorAdapter` interface in `adapter.ts` diverges from the spec-defined contract on multiple points:

- **Method names**: spec defines `listIssues`, `createPR`, `mergePR`, `getPRStatus`; implementation has `queryIssues`, `createPr`, `mergePr`, `getPrStatus`
- **`createIssue` return type**: spec returns `{ number: number; url: string }`; implementation returns `number` (URL discarded)
- **`getPRStatus` return type**: spec returns `{ mergeable, ci_status: 'success'|'failure'|'pending', reviews: [...] }`; implementation returns `{ mergeable, mergeStateStatus: string }` — missing `ci_status` union type and `reviews` array
- **`updateIssue` parameters**: spec has `labels_add?: string[]` and `labels_remove?: string[]` in the update object; implementation has neither (separate `addLabels`/`removeLabels` methods exist but `updateIssue` doesn't accept label mutations)

The spec explicitly states: "The interface above is the target — implement incrementally." The interface is already fully defined in `adapter.ts` — so the names and shapes must match the spec even if not all call sites are migrated yet.

### Gate 2 FAIL — No tests for new adapter instantiation branches

The new `if (filterRepo && !deps.adapter)` block in `orchestrateCommandWithDeps` (~line 1004) and the `const adapter = repo ? createAdapter(...) : undefined` in `processRequestsCommand` (line 323) introduce testable conditional branches that have no corresponding test coverage:

- Existing test `'stores --label and --repo filters'` (orchestrate.test.ts:200) triggers the `filterRepo && !deps.adapter` path but only asserts on `state.filter_label` / `state.filter_repo` — it does NOT verify that `deps.adapter` was populated after the call
- No test covers the negative case (no `repo` → adapter remains undefined)
- `processRequestsCommand` has no unit tests at all in `process-requests.test.ts` — the new adapter creation in that function is entirely untested

### Gate 4 FAIL — Code quality: DI bypass and unnecessary dynamic import

Two issues in `orchestrateCommandWithDeps` ~line 1004–1011:

1. `const { spawnSync: nodeSpawnSync } = await import('node:child_process')` — dynamic import inside a conditional for a built-in module that is always available in Node.js. Must be a static top-level import.

2. `const execGhFn = deps.execGh ?? (async (args) => { const result = nodeSpawnSync('gh', args, ...) ... })` — this fallback silently injects a real child-process-spawning function when `deps.execGh` is absent. All existing tests using `createMockDeps()` omit `execGh`, so every test that passes `repo: '...'` will create an adapter backed by real `spawnSync`. If adapter methods are ever called in those test contexts (which they will be once migration proceeds), tests will attempt real `gh` CLI calls and fail unpredictably. The fallback defeats the dependency injection purpose.

### Gates 3, 5 — Blocked by QA environment

TypeScript build and unit test suite could not be executed (Bash tool non-functional in QA env — tracked as `[qa/P1]` in TODO.md). Gate 3 coverage and Gate 5 regression status not independently verified by this review.

### Gates 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Work is purely internal TypeScript type additions and plumbing (no observable output) — skip is correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed; docs not required
- Gate 10: QA_COVERAGE.md exists; no stale P1 bugs older than 3 iterations

## Review — 2026-03-28 — commits 298ac3309..d49686908 (build iterations 18 + 30)

**Verdict: FAIL** (2 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/lib/adapter.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/lib/adapter.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/lib/plan.ts`

### Gate 1 — PASS (prior finding resolved)

Interface in `adapter.ts` now exactly matches SPEC-ADDENDUM.md §"Orchestrator Adapter Pattern":
- `listIssues`, `createPR`, `mergePR`, `getPRStatus` — correct names ✓
- `createIssue` returns `{ number, url }` ✓
- `updateIssue` accepts `labels_add`/`labels_remove` ✓
- `getPRStatus` returns `{ mergeable, ci_status, reviews }` ✓

### Gate 2 FAIL — No tests for `updateIssue`; `listComments` since-filter untested

`updateIssue` (adapter.ts:77-96) is the most complex method in the adapter — it makes up to 4+ separate `gh` calls depending on the update shape — but `adapter.test.ts` has **zero tests** for it. `describe('GitHubAdapter')` in the test file has sections for every other method but no `describe('updateIssue')` block at all.

Additionally, `listComments` (adapter.ts:227-237) has a `since` timestamp filter branch (lines 233-235) that is exercised by zero tests — the only test calls `listComments(5)` with no `since` argument.

### Gate 3 FAIL — 0% branch coverage for `updateIssue`

`updateIssue` has five conditional branches (body, labels_add, labels_remove, state=closed, state=open). None are covered.

### Gate 4 — PASS

Prior Gate 4 finding (dynamic `import('node:child_process')` + silent DI bypass in `orchestrateCommandWithDeps`) resolved by removing the adapter threading code (deferred to "Up Next"). No dead code detected in changed files. Removed dist artifacts from tracking is appropriate cleanup.

### Gate 5 — FAIL (pre-existing regressions from d49686908, tracked as [qa/P1])

`npm run type-check` fails with 10 TypeScript errors; `npm test` has 22 top-level test failures (47 sub-test failures):
- `process-requests.test.ts` imports 6 now-deleted exports (`formatReviewCommentHistory`, `getDirectorySizeBytes`, `pruneLargeV8CacheDir`, `syncMasterToTrunk`, `syncChildBranches`, `ChildBranchSyncDeps`)
- `orchestrate.test.ts` references `priority` field deleted from `EstimateResult`
- `process-requests.ts:385` has a type overlap error

These are already tracked as `[qa/P1]` items in TODO.md (filed 2026-03-28). No duplicate `[review]` tasks added.

### Gates 6-9 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Internal TypeScript changes only — skip correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed

## Review — 2026-03-28 — commits 8e1208aaf..82ffc2a71 (build: updateIssue tests + export restoration)

**Verdict: FAIL** (1 finding → written to TODO.md as [review] task)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/lib/adapter.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`

### Gate 1 — PASS

Interface alignment resolved in prior iteration; no spec-relevant changes in this build.

### Gate 2 — PASS (prior findings resolved)

`updateIssue` tests (`adapter.test.ts:91-155`) are concrete: 6 cases cover all 5 conditional branches with exact `calls.length` assertions and per-call arg checks. `listComments` since-filter tests (`adapter.test.ts:402-435`) test both partial-filter and all-old-comments cases with exact `comments.length` and `body` assertions. All 8 new tests pass.

### Gate 3 — PASS (prior findings resolved)

All branches of `updateIssue` covered. `listComments` since-filter branch covered.

### Gate 4 — PASS

Restored functions have no dead code. New `stat` and `rm` imports are used. No stray TODOs.

### Gate 5 — FAIL — TypeScript type error not fixed in process-requests.ts

`npm run type-check` fails with 4 errors. The current build resolved the export-restoration P1 but left one type error unfixed:

- `process-requests.ts(551,71)` — `issue.state !== 'review'` is an impossible comparison because `OrchestratorIssueState` has no `'review'` member. This error was present before (line 385) and shifted to 551 after the 168-line insertion. The `[qa/P1]` was marked `[x]` resolved based on test passage, but `tsc --noEmit` still fails.
- Pre-existing (not introduced by this build): `orchestrate.test.ts` 3 errors (`priority` field), tracked as qa/P1 for orchestrate.ts label enrichment. 46 test failures from same P1.

1 new `[review]` task written to TODO.md.

### Gates 6-10 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Internal test additions + export restoration — no observable output; skip correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed
- Gate 10: All `[qa/P1]` bugs filed 2026-03-28 (< 3 iterations old)

## Review — 2026-03-28 — commits 5cd8c898b..8a2efa43b (build: review-state fix + label enrichment)

**Verdict: PASS** (2 observations)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`

### Gate 1 — PASS

Prior Gate 5 finding resolved: `'review'` added to `OrchestratorIssueState` union, eliminating TS2367 at `process-requests.ts:551`. Label enrichment fix restores `wave/${wave}` and `deriveComponentLabels` in `applyDecompositionPlan`.

### Gate 2 — PASS

Suite 395 ("applyDecompositionPlan label enrichment") subtests 1–4 all pass with concrete value assertions:
- `labels.includes('wave/1')` / `labels.includes('wave/2')` — not just shape checks
- Component label presence verified with exact string (`'component/orchestrator'`)
- Empty `file_hints` correctly produces no component labels

Subtests 5, 6, 8 fail (dependency body injection), but these are pre-existing tracked qa/P1 bugs, not new regressions.

### Gate 3 — PASS

The one-line `labels` change introduces two branches (`file_hints` present vs absent via `?? []`). Both are covered by subtests 2 and 4. `OrchestratorIssueState` union addition has no runtime branch to cover.

### Gate 4 — PASS

`deriveComponentLabels` import used, no dead code. No leftover TODOs or commented-out code in touched files.

### Gate 5 — PASS (prior finding resolved)

`tsc --noEmit`: 3 errors remain, all pre-existing qa/P1 (priority field in EstimateResult in test file). Zero errors in non-test sources. Test suite: 41 failures, all pre-existing. No new regressions introduced by this build.

Observation: Gate 5 finding from last review (TS2367 at process-requests.ts:551) confirmed fixed at `ffb36b37f`.

### Gates 6–10 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Internal TypeScript type/label changes — skip correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed
- Gate 10: QA coverage 75% (12/16 features PASS); open P1 bugs filed 2026-03-28 (< 3 iterations old)

## Review — 2026-03-30 — commits 3f2287b93..fce7c6c30 (build: dep injection + label enrichment + adapter threading)

**Verdict: FAIL** (2 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`

### Gate 1 — PASS

- `applyDecompositionPlan`: appends "Depends on #X, #Y" to issue body when `depends_on` is non-empty; stores enriched body in state. Matches TODO and AC 6 intent. ✓
- `applyEstimateResults`: adds `complexity/<tier>` and `priority` labels via `execGh` after DoR passes, guarded by `deps.execGh && deps.repo`. ✓
- Adapter field threading (`adapter?` in all 5 deps interfaces + pass-through in `runTriageMonitorCycle`, `runOrchestratorScanPass`, `process-requests.ts`) is aligned with the incremental migration plan. ✓

### Gate 2 FAIL — Adapter instantiation branch untested

`process-requests.ts:941-943` — `const adapter = repo ? createAdapter(...) : undefined` is a two-branch conditional with zero test coverage:
- No test verifies adapter is created when `repo` is provided and flows into `scanDeps.adapter`, `prLifecycleDeps.adapter`, and `dispatchDeps.adapter`
- No test verifies adapter is `undefined` when `repo` is absent

This is the same class of finding as the first review (2026-03-27 Gate 2), which was closed as N/A when the code was removed. Code is back; finding re-opens.

Additionally: there are 302 lines of uncommitted adapter-migration changes in `orchestrate.ts` (working tree) marked as done in TODO. Every new `if (deps.adapter) ... else { execGh }` dual-path adds an untested adapter branch. These must be committed with tests before the next review.

### Gate 3 FAIL — 0% branch coverage for `repo ? createAdapter(...) : undefined`

Both branches of the conditional at `process-requests.ts:941-943` are uncovered.

### Gate 4 — PASS

- `createAdapter` and `OrchestratorAdapter` imports are used. No dead imports.
- `deps.execGh && deps.repo` guard before label call is correct — avoids passing `undefined` to execGh array.
- No dead code or leftover TODOs in changed files.

### Gate 5 — PASS

- `tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors (first time in this session). ✓
- 1099/1134 tests pass; 34 failures all pre-existing (QA confirms: "exactly matches pre-regression baseline"). No new regressions. ✓
- `npm run build` clean. ✓

Observation: Gate 2 finding at `applyEstimateResults` (ok 396): test subtests 1–6 are concrete — exact `--add-label` value checks, combined-label verification, and no-label-when-absent assertions. Thorough.

### Gates 6–9 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Internal TypeScript plumbing only; skip correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed

## Review — 2026-03-30 — commits 41a3f3f63..d45b8a5d6 (build: test coverage for review Gate 2/3 findings)

**Verdict: PASS** (1 observation)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.test.ts`

### Gate 1 — PASS

Three prior review findings addressed:
1. `makeAdapterForRepo` extracted from `processRequestsCommand` and tested (branch coverage for `repo ? createAdapter : undefined`).
2. Adapter-branch tests added for `applyTriageResultsToIssue`, `resolveSpecQuestionIssues`, `mergePr`, `flagForHuman`, `processPrLifecycle`.
3. `adapter: deps.adapter` added to `resolveSpecQuestionIssues` call at `orchestrate.ts:5496` — prior finding that the adapter branch was unreachable in production is fixed. ✓

### Gate 2 — PASS (prior findings resolved)

All new tests are concrete:
- `makeAdapterForRepo` tests (a1): `instanceof GitHubAdapter` check ✓; (b1): `strictEqual(adapter, undefined)` ✓. Both branches of the conditional covered with exact-value assertions.
- Orchestrate adapter-branch tests use `execGh: async () => { throw new Error('execGh should not be called') }` pattern — any fallthrough to execGh would fail the test, confirming the adapter path is exercised.
- `applyTriageResultsToIssue` test 1: checks exact `entries[0].classification`, `postCalls[0].args[0] === 42`, `deepStrictEqual(updateCalls[0].args[1], { labels_add: ['aloop/blocked-on-human'] })` ✓
- `mergePr` test 1: `result.merged === true`, `mergeCalls[0].args[0] === 100`, `args[1] === 'squash'` ✓; test 2 covers error path ✓
- `resolveSpecQuestionIssues` test 1: `stats.autoResolved === 1`, exact label assertions in updateIssue and closeIssue calls ✓

**Observation**: `makeAdapterForRepo` tests (a2) and (b2) are tautological — they manually construct `{ adapter, prLifecycleDeps: { adapter }, dispatchDeps: { adapter } }` and assert each slot equals `adapter`, proving nothing about production threading code. These are noise. The critical branch (the conditional) is covered by (a1)/(b1); the threading itself is trivially simple (one-line assignments), so this is not a blocking weakness.

### Gate 3 — PASS

`makeAdapterForRepo` has 2 branches: truthy `repo` (test a1) and null `repo` (test b1) — both covered. All `if (deps.adapter)` adapter branches in the 5 orchestrate functions now have explicit tests. No new uncovered branches introduced.

### Gate 4 — PASS

`makeAdapterForRepo` export is used at `process-requests.ts:950`. `@internal exported for testing` JSDoc is appropriate. `createMockAdapter` helper in test file is fully used. No dead code, no leftover TODOs, no duplication.

### Gate 5 — PASS

- `tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors ✓
- Tests: 1113/1148 pass; 34 fail — 34 is the confirmed pre-existing baseline (unchanged from prior review) ✓
- `npm run build`: clean ✓
- 14 new tests added (4 `makeAdapterForRepo` + 10 adapter-branch), all pass ✓

### Gates 6–9 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Internal test additions and one-line fix; skip correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed

## Review — 2026-03-30 12:00 — commit 2de5aeefc..097fc63ba

**Verdict: PASS** (0 findings)
**Scope:** `orchestrate.ts`, `process-requests.ts`, `adapter.ts`, `orchestrate.test.ts`, `process-requests.test.ts`
**Commits reviewed:** `45c344642` (scanLoop/bulk-fetch adapter), `364b994e3` (refine-result adapter), `097fc63ba` (meta.json adapter config)

### Gate 1 — PASS

Spec §"Orchestrator Adapter Pattern" acceptance criteria satisfied:
- `fetchAndApplyBulkIssueState` uses `adapter.fetchBulkIssueState` when available, falls back to raw execGh ✓
- `createTrunkToMainPr` uses `adapter.createPR`; PR-already-exists recovery guarded to execGh-only (no `listPRs` on adapter — documented in comment) ✓
- `createPrForChild` / `monitorChildSessions` use `adapter.createPR`; branch-existence check guarded to execGh-only (documented) ✓
- `updateIssueBodyViaAdapter` extracted and used in the refine-result handler ✓
- `meta.adapter` read from meta.json and forwarded to `makeAdapterForRepo` as `adapterType` ✓

### Gate 2 — PASS

Tests are concrete and adversarial:
- `updateIssueBodyViaAdapter` test (a): exact `adapterCalls[0].number === 42`, `deepEqual(update, { body: 'new body text' })`, `fallbackCalled === false` — would catch any body routing bug ✓
- `createTrunkToMainPr` adapter test: `execGh: async () => { throw new Error('execGh should not be called') }` pattern — any fallthrough fails the test ✓
- `monitorChildSessions` test (b): verifies base defaults to `'main'` when no execGh (exact value check on `createPrCalls[0].args[3]`) ✓
- `makeAdapterForRepo` adapterType tests: `instanceof GitHubAdapter`, throws `/Unknown adapter type: "gitlab"/` — covers type-routing branches ✓
- `fetchAndApplyBulkIssueState` adapter test: `bulkFetchCalls.length === 1` with execGh set to throw — any fallthrough would fail ✓

### Gate 3 — PASS

All new branches covered. Non-blocking note: the branch where adapter is present but `fetchBulkIssueState?` is absent (optional method, falls back to execGh) has no dedicated test — covered by pre-existing execGh path tests.

### Gate 4 — PASS

`fetchBulkIssueState?` correctly takes `opts?` without `repo` (repo bound in constructor). All execGh-only fallbacks documented inline. No dead code, no leftover TODOs.

### Gate 5 — PASS

`tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors; `npm run build`: clean. 1124 pass, 34 fail (confirmed pre-existing baseline). 8 new tests all pass.

### Gates 6–9 — Pass / N/A

Gate 6: Purely internal migration — QA confirmed 27 pre-existing orchestrate failures unchanged. Gates 7–9: No UI, no new deps, no user-facing behavior changed.

## Review — 2026-03-30 — commits fa87faf93..b22acbd5e (build: process-requests adapter migration + applyDecompositionPlan + runTriageMonitorCycle)

**Verdict: FAIL** (3 findings → written to TODO.md as [review] tasks)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`
**Commits reviewed:** `ecad85f99` (process-requests adapter migration), `a33ba1099` (applyDecompositionPlan + runTriageMonitorCycle adapter + tests)

### Gate 1 — PASS

- `process-requests.ts`: `createGhIssue()` replaced by `adapter.createIssue()` in sub-decomposition and Phase 2; `updateParentTasklist()` refactored to `adapter.getIssue()` + `adapter.updateIssue()`; Phase 2c `spawnSync('gh', ['pr', 'create', ...])` replaced by `adapter.createPR()`. Guards changed from `if (repo)` to `if (adapter)`. All spec-aligned incremental migration. ✓
- `applyDecompositionPlan`: `deps.adapter.createIssue()` tried first with `execGhIssueCreate` fallback. ✓
- `runTriageMonitorCycle`: adapter path added with `adapter.listComments()` per issue/PR. ✓

### Gate 2 FAIL — Broken runTriageMonitorCycle adapter tests + missing process-requests coverage

**Finding 1 — Test tracking lost in override:** Both new `runTriageMonitorCycle` tests (`orchestrate.test.ts:1580` and `1619`) call `createMockAdapter({ listComments: async (...) => {...} })`. The `...overrides` spread inside `createMockAdapter` (line 2831) replaces the tracked `listComments` implementation with the untracked override, so `calls` never records `listComments` calls. `listCalls.length` is always 0. Tests fail at `assert.equal(listCalls.length, 1)` and `assert.equal(listCalls.length, 2)`. Root cause: override swallows the `calls.push` tracking wiring, not missing production code.

**Finding 2 — No tests for process-requests adapter paths:** `ecad85f99` replaced four `spawnSync`/`createGhIssue` call-sites with adapter calls but added zero tests: `adapter.createIssue()` in sub-decomp (line 419), `adapter.createIssue()` in Phase 2 (line ~542), `adapter.createPR()` in Phase 2c (line ~659), `updateParentTasklist()` refactor using `adapter.getIssue()` + `adapter.updateIssue()` (lines 1149-1163).

### Gate 3 FAIL — 0% coverage for process-requests.ts adapter branches

All four `if (adapter)` guarded paths in `process-requests.ts` from `ecad85f99` are uncovered: sub-decomp adapter path, Phase 2 adapter path, Phase 2c adapter path, and full `updateParentTasklist` refactor.

### Gate 4 FAIL — execGhForTriage DI bypass

`orchestrate.ts:2120-2125`: `deps.execGh ?? (async (args) => { const { spawnSync } = await import('node:child_process'); ... })` — when `deps.execGh` is absent (adapter-only mode), a real `spawnSync('gh', ...)` fallback is injected into `applyTriageResultsToIssue`. This is the same DI bypass pattern flagged in the first review (2026-03-27 Gate 4). CONSTITUTION rule #4 violation — silent bypass of dependency injection. Any future `applyTriageResultsToIssue` call that uses `execGh` in adapter-only mode will spawn real `gh` CLI.

### Gate 5 FAIL — 2 new test regressions

Test count: 36 fail vs 34-failure pre-existing baseline. The 2 new failures are the broken `runTriageMonitorCycle` adapter tests. `tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors ✓. `npm run build`: clean ✓.

### Gates 6–9 — Pass / N/A

- Gate 6: Internal TypeScript plumbing — no observable output; skip correct
- Gate 7: No UI changes
- Gate 8: No new dependencies
- Gate 9: No user-facing behavior changed

## Review — 2026-03-30 — commits e3780bf89..f87f9ee0b (fixes: createMockAdapter tracking + execGhForTriage removal)

**Verdict: FAIL** (1 finding → written to TODO.md as [review] task)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`
**Commits reviewed:** `7b8ba4bfd` (createMockAdapter override tracking), `644b2663c` (remove execGhForTriage bypass), `f87f9ee0b` (qa documentation)

### Gate 1 — PASS

- `7b8ba4bfd`: test-infrastructure fix only — `trackedOverrides` wrapper ensures `calls.push` fires before delegating to override. Correct and aligned with adapter DI design.
- `644b2663c`: removes inline `spawnSync('gh', ...)` fallback at `runTriageMonitorCycle`. `TriageDeps.execGh` is now optional. `execGh!` assertions in `applyTriageResultsToIssue` appear only in `else` branches guarded by `!deps.adapter`, which is structurally safe for the current caller. Aligns with CONSTITUTION rule #4. ✓

### Gate 2 — PARTIAL (prior finding resolved; one carry-forward open)

- Prior finding **"Gate 2/Gate 5: broken runTriageMonitorCycle adapter tests"** resolved: `runTriageMonitorCycle` suite now reports both adapter tests passing (`ok 3 - uses adapter.listComments when adapter is present`, `ok 4 - adapter path fetches PR comments via listComments`). Confirmed `listCalls.length` assertions work correctly after override wrapping fix.
- Prior finding **"Gate 2/Gate 3: Add adapter-path tests for process-requests.ts"** is still **open** (`[ ]` in TODO.md). Neither commit touches `process-requests.ts`. The four adapter paths (`adapter.createIssue()` at lines 419 and 544, `adapter.createPR()` at line 663, `adapter.getIssue()` + `adapter.updateIssue()` at lines 1156-1160) remain at 0% test coverage.

### Gate 3 — FAIL (carry-forward)

`process-requests.ts` adapter branches from `ecad85f99` are still uncovered. The `[review]` task was not actioned in this build iteration.

### Gate 4 — PASS

`644b2663c` removes the `execGhForTriage` inline cleanly. No new dead code. `execGh` optional field with non-null assertion is acceptable given the existing dual-path invariant, though a future caller must know to supply at least one of `adapter` or `execGh`. No CONSTITUTION violations.

### Gate 5 — PASS

- `npm test`: 1128 pass, 34 fail — back to pre-existing baseline; the 2 regressions from prior FAIL are resolved ✓
- `tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors ✓
- `npm run build`: clean ✓

### Gates 6–9 — Pass / N/A

No UI changes, no new dependencies, no user-facing behavior changed, no docs required.

## Review — 2026-03-30 — commits 2fd11b958..0d8043811 (build: process-requests helpers + checkPrGates adapter path)

**Verdict: PASS** (1 observation)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/process-requests.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/lib/adapter.ts`
**Commits reviewed:** `dedbba6cd` (adapter-path tests for process-requests.ts), `0d8043811` (checkPrGates adapter migration)

### Gate 1 — PASS

- `dedbba6cd`: Extracts `applySubDecompositionResult`, `createGhIssuesForNewEntries`, `createPRViaAdapter` as `@internal` tested helpers. Inline `spawnSync`/`createGhIssue` call-sites replaced by adapter calls — exactly the four branches flagged in prior review. ✓
- `0d8043811`: `checkPrGates` Gate 1 now uses `adapter.getPRStatus()`, Gate 2 now uses `adapter.getPrChecks()` when adapter present, with execGh fallback. `getPrChecks` added to `OrchestratorAdapter` interface — additive extension serving per-check detail reporting; not in spec's baseline interface but aligns with spec intent. ✓

### Gate 2 — PASS (prior finding resolved)

Prior finding "Gate 2/Gate 3: Add adapter-path tests for process-requests.ts changes" fully resolved. 19 new concrete tests:
- `updateParentTasklist` test 2: explicit negative assertion that `updateIssue` is NOT called when body already contains `[tasklist]` — idempotency invariant enforced ✓
- `createPRViaAdapter` test 1: exact title format `'#10: My Issue'`, body substrings `'Closes #10'`/`'child-session-10'`, exact branch name `'aloop/issue-10'`, exact state transitions (`pr_number: 99`, `state: 'pr_open'`, `status: 'In review'`) ✓
- `checkPrGates` adapter tests: `execGh: async () => { throw new Error('execGh should not be called') }` pattern — any fallthrough fails the test ✓

**Observation**: `createPRViaAdapter` test 2 (line ~3090) asserts `issue.pr_number === null` after adapter returns 0 — verifies the "no update on invalid PR number" invariant with an exact null check, not just a truthy check.

### Gate 3 — PASS

All four extracted helpers have dedicated suites covering >90% branch coverage. One minor untested edge in `applySubDecompositionResult` (adapter returns `ghNumber=0`, falls to `nextNum++`) — non-blocking at overall >90% coverage for new modules. All `checkPrGates` adapter branches covered by 5 tests.

### Gate 4 — PASS

`@internal exported for testing` JSDoc on all helpers is appropriate. No dead code. No duplication — extracted logic replaces inline code exactly. No leftover TODOs. Pre-existing `HACK` comment references issue #164.

### Gate 5 — PASS

- `tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors ✓
- `npm run build`: clean ✓
- Tests: 1148 pass, 34 fail — 34 is confirmed pre-existing baseline (unchanged, 19 additional passing tests vs prior 1128/34 baseline) ✓

### Gates 6–9 — Pass / N/A

Gate 6: Purely internal TypeScript plumbing — no observable output; skip correct. Gates 7–9: No UI, no new dependencies, no user-facing behavior changed.

## Review — 2026-03-30 — commits b531b889a..bcf06191d (build: applyEstimateResults adapter + README fix)

**Verdict: PASS** (1 observation)
**Scope:** `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.ts`, `aloop/cli/src/commands/orchestrate.test.ts`, `README.md`

### Gate 1 — PASS

`applyEstimateResults` migration aligns with SPEC-ADDENDUM §"Orchestrator Adapter Pattern": adapter is used with fallback to execGh/execGhIssueCreate for both label ops and spec-question issue creation. The `adapter: deps.adapter` threading at the `runOrchestrateCycle` call site correctly wires the adapter through. Matches the incremental migration intent.

### Gate 2 — PASS

4 concrete adversarial tests (`applyEstimateResults adapter path`):
1. Test 1 (`uses adapter.updateIssue for label ops when DoR passes`): checks exact issue number (10), exact `labels_add: ['complexity/M', 'P1']`, and `execGh: async () => { throw ... }` guards against fallthrough ✓
2. Test 2 (`uses adapter.createIssue for spec-question when DoR fails with gaps`): verifies 2 createIssue calls for 2 gaps, exact title content per gap, exact labels arg `['aloop/spec-question']` ✓
3. Test 3 (`falls back to execGh for label ops when no adapter`): verifies `--add-label` and `complexity/S` appear in actual ghCalls ✓
4. Test 4 (`falls back to execGhIssueCreate for spec-question when no adapter`): verifies exact count (1) and title content including `[spec-question] #40` ✓

### Gate 3 — PASS

All 4 new conditional branches covered: adapter path for labels_add, execGh fallback, adapter path for createIssue, execGhIssueCreate fallback.

### Gate 4 — PASS

Non-null assertions (`deps.execGh!`, `deps.execGhIssueCreate!`) are sound — both inside `else` branches reachable only when adapter is absent AND their respective execGh/execGhIssueCreate are present (guarded by outer `||`). No dead code. No leftover TODOs.

### Gate 5 — PASS

- `tsc --noEmit`: 0 errors ✓
- Tests: 1152/1187 pass; 34 fail — confirmed pre-existing baseline (unchanged from prior review) ✓
- `npm run build`: clean ✓
- 4 new tests (applyEstimateResults adapter path, ok 398): all pass ✓

### Gate 6 — PASS (N/A)

Purely internal TypeScript migration; no observable output — skip correct.

### Gate 7 — N/A

No UI changes.

### Gate 8 — N/A

No new dependencies.

### Gate 9 — PASS

README.md fix (`--launch-mode resume --session-dir` → `aloop start <session-id> --launch resume`) verified against `src/index.ts:76,81` — argument is `[session-id]` positional, flag is `--launch <mode>`. Fix is accurate. Dashboard decomposition note is informational and consistent with SPEC-ADDENDUM state.
